<h4>Mod Packs</h4>

<p>I am a fan of mod packs and have no problem with the mod jar files being included in mod packs. In general and specifically to mod packs, follow the license and you can do what you wish with my mods.</p>

<ul>
<li>Attribution: Give proper credit. This is best done by including a link to the mod's related web page.</li>
<li>NonCommercial: These mods are free, don't charge money for them.</li>
<li>ShareAlike: Code was shared with you, if you make it better, then share it with others.</li>
